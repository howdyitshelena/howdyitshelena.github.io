						<h2>Violin Cake</h2>
						<span class="ps-price">M</span>
						<p>y coworker approached me and asked me to make a cake for her daughter’s 12th birthday.  She had a great idea and really wanted to surprise her with violin cake, as her daughter plays the instrument (and from the video I saw is already quite good!).I had so much fun with this cake!  I, myself, have played the violin since I was 11 years old.  I have always dreamed of making my own violin and still plan to eventually… But being given an opportunity to make an edible version of the instrument, I jumped at the chance!</p>

						<h2>Louboutin Shoes</h2>
						<span class="ps-price">T</span>
						<p>his was my first time making shoes!  It was definitely a challenge – and not to mention on a time crunch! The shoebox is a classic chocolate-chocolate cake with vanilla fondant.  The shoes and ribbon were out of modeling chocolate.  Shoes were modeled off of an image of the Louboutin Escandria Pumps.  I somehow managed to do the full cake and shoe display in a week (lesson learned… never again will I allocate such little time…).</p>

						<h2>Books</h2>
						<span class="ps-price">"E</span>
						<p>veryone was making a big deal over something, and all I saw were a stack of books.  And then, I realized.  Those weren’t books.  They were the wedding cake!  I thought they were real!” - -Dr. Marisa P. Clark, officiant &amp; guest.<br>I made this cake on site in Truth or Consequences.  The Pelican Spa, where Sam and Randi got married, was really great for this!  I brought my tools and purchased miscellaneous needs from a local store, and was able to use the oven in one of the kitchens allocated for guest use.

Marbled rum cake.  As Randi is vegan, this cake was made with marzipan rather than fondant.</p>

						<h2>Penguin</h2>
						<span class="ps-price">T</span>
						<p>his was my first baby shower cake!  My friend Natalie asked me for a cake early on, but didn’t know details at the time since her closest friends were planning everything and surprising her with the details.  They sent me a picture of the baby shower card that they picked out — Penguins.  Extremely appropriate for Natalie.</p>
